# Simulate Static URLs TYPO3 Extension

**Adds the possibility to have Speaking URLs in the TYPO3 Frontend pages.**

The extension was excluded from the TYPO3 core with version 6.0 
and is available from the TER (version 2.0.0).

Unfortunately version 2.0.0 does no longer work with TYPO3 (e.g. v7.6) due to api changes. 
There's no official git repository as I know, so I put this stuff here.

This version is updated to work with TYPO3 7.6. It might work with 6.0 to 8.x, 
but this is untested. Please give feedback (see [Contribute](#contribute)).

## Usage

Have a look into the *Documentation* folder for more information. 
There are also some tutorials online.

## Roadmap

There's none. Just keep this extension working and fix bugs.

Generally I still like the concept of simulatestatic. And for many use cases it is just fine. 
But instead of working on this extension for new features,
I would prefer to write a new cleaner extension with the same features (and some more).
